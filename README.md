Q: What is the essential difference between graph structure and tree structure?
A: Graph and tree structures are both commonly used in computer science and data structures. While they share some
similarities, there are also some key differences between them.

A graph is a collection of vertices (also called nodes) and edges, where an edge is a connection between two vertices.
Edges can be directed or undirected and can have weights (costs or distances). Graphs can be used to model relationships
between entities, such as social networks, transportation networks, or computer networks. Graphs can be cyclic, meaning
that it is possible to follow a path from a vertex back to itself.

A tree, on the other hand, is a type of graph where each node has exactly one parent, except for the root node which has
no parent. Trees are used to represent hierarchical structures, such as file systems, organization charts, and family
trees. Trees are always acyclic, meaning there are no cycles in the graph.

The key difference between graph and tree structures is that trees have a hierarchical structure with a single root node
and a specific parent-child relationship between nodes, while graphs do not necessarily have a specific hierarchy or
parent-child relationship between nodes. Additionally, trees are always acyclic, while graphs can be either cyclic or
acyclic.

Q: So if I want to design a navigation between mobile pages, which structure should I use?
A: If you are designing a navigation between mobile pages, a tree structure would be a suitable choice. This is because
mobile app navigation typically follows a hierarchical structure, where each screen is accessed through a series of
parent-child relationships.

For example, consider the navigation of a typical e-commerce app: a user might start on a home screen, then navigate to
a product category screen, then to a specific product screen, and finally to a shopping cart screen. This navigation
follows a hierarchical structure, where each screen has a single parent (the screen that was accessed immediately before
it) and multiple children (the screens that can be accessed directly from it).

Using a tree structure to represent the navigation between mobile pages allows you to easily visualize the hierarchy of
the screens and the relationships between them. You can use a tree structure to organize your app's screens, with the
home screen at the root of the tree and each subsequent screen represented as a child node. This can help you ensure
that your app's navigation is intuitive and easy to use for your users.

Q: Not all pages have only one parent node. The navigation design of jetpack compose and swft UI looks more like a graph
structure.
A: You are correct that not all mobile app screens have a single parent node, and some app navigations may require a
more complex graph structure rather than a simple tree structure.

Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI are both examples of UI frameworks that use a graph structure to represent mobile app
navigation. In these frameworks, screens are represented as nodes in a graph, with edges representing the possible
navigational paths between them. This allows for more complex app navigations, where screens can have multiple parents
and can be accessed through multiple paths.

A graph structure can be a good choice for more complex mobile app navigations, where screens can be accessed through
multiple paths or where the app's structure is not hierarchical. However, it is important to ensure that the navigation
remains intuitive and easy to use for your users, even with a more complex graph structure. You may want to consider
using visual cues, such as color coding or icons, to help users understand the relationships between screens and to make
it clear which navigational paths are available to them.
